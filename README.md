# mmeasureunit
## What is it?
"mmeasureunit" is a micro measure unit manipulation C++ header-only library based on std::chrono capabilities. 
Library provides few simple abstractions on common units with compile time evaluation and conversion.

## Why not boost?

Boost::Units seems a bit overhead for some tasks. Yes, it provides awesome interface to 
build complex units (like newtons) but this library is designed to be lightweight and 
extremely easy to use so only abstraction used here is unit itself (length, weight, angle etc.).
And no boost dependency here.


## Why should I use this library instead of %libName%?

That's your and only your choice. Just look how it can be used:

```CPP
TODO: place use example here
```

## How it works?

All library abstractions (models of measure units) based on std::

## Can I?...
